# React Server-Side Rendering Example

Inside SRC goes your React project. Then remember to add dependencies of your project to this local package.json.

Then run npm run server-render to build your src React code, and then run a node with express server to load bundled data



## Setup
```
$ npm install
$ npm run server-render
```
